# Overview
"The Informed Airline Customer Support Agent" is an advanced, AI-powered conversational chatbot designed to revolutionize customer interaction within the airline industry. By integrating powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) with specialized external APIs and internal data, this project creates an intelligent and multimodal agent capable of providing comprehensive, real-time, and engaging support to airline passengers. It aims to offer a seamless and rich user experience, transforming routine inquiries into informed and visually/auditorily enhanced interactions.

# Technology Stack
 * Core LLM: Groq API services
 * External APIs:
   * OpenAI API for TTS (Text-To-Speech)
   * Flux for image generation
 * Programming Language: Python
 * User Interface: Gradio

# Key Learnings and Skills Gained
-  Applied **few-shot prompting** to reduce hallucination and ensure high factual accuracy in chatbot responses.
-  Integrated **multimodal capabilities** (text, voice, visuals) using a combination of TTS and image generation APIs.
-  Leveraged **external tools** for real-time query resolution and enhanced user experience.
-  Built a **lightweight yet functional interface** using Gradio for easy interaction and rapid testing.
-  Gained hands-on experience with **Groq's LLM APIs** and managing stateful chatbot interactions.

# Impact and Benefits:
"The Informed Airline Customer Support Agent" significantly enhances the customer service landscape by:
  * Improving Efficiency: Automating resposne to frequent queries and guiding users through common processes reduces the workload on human agents.
  * Boosting User Satisfaction: Provide instant, accurate and engaging multimodel responses.
  * Rich Interaction: The combination of Text, voice and dynamic visuals makes the interaction more immersive and informative then traditional text-only-chatbots.
  * Scalability: The architecture allows to easy expansion of features and integration with more data in the future.

# Final Thoughts
This project demonstrates how thoughtful integration of AI technologies can reshape customer support in the airline industry. By merging cutting-edge LLMs with TTS and image tools, the agent delivers a far more **engaging**, **helpful**, and **scalable** support system than traditional bots.

# Challenges Faced and Area of Improvement needed:
- API Latency: Real-time performance was sometimes affected by latency from external APIs, especially during image generation or TTS processing.

- Hallucinations from LLM: Despite few-shot prompting, the model occasionally generated inaccurate information, especially for highly specific airline queries like pricing. This was partially addressed using structured external data.

- Multimodal Syncing: Synchronizing audio, visual, and text responses to create a cohesive user experience required careful flow control and interface design.

- Gradio UI Limitations: Gradio was fast for prototyping but limited in advanced UI customization.

These challenges were valuable learning experience, In upcoming projects i will try to improve on this funtionalities by applying more scalable design patterns, optimizing performance.
